    "text": "Abstract\nFirms increasingly implement AI agents, such as recommendation algorithms and chatbots, to enhance customer value. Although extant research suggests customers react negatively to AI agent implementation, in some instances it can lead to positive customer reactions. To address and clarify these mixed findings, a meta-analysis of 266 effect sizes reported in 48 articles with 50,976 participants helps specify the conditions in which managers should inform customers about AI agent implementation. The results confirm that, on average, customers react negatively to AI agent implementation, but the effect is qualified by both AI characteristics that are under managers’ control (AI type, interactivity, disclosure of AI performance metrics) and exogenous contextual characteristics (product type, industry risk level, interaction outcome). These findings contribute to AI research in marketing and offer crucial managerial insights. They also suggest a detailed agenda for continued research."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nNew technologies powered by artificial intelligence and robotics continue to populate human life. We pose the fundamental question whether progress of technology and humankind are perceived as zero-sum. We focus on autonomy, a key resource that is increasingly shared with new technologies, defined as the capacity to initiate and execute actions independently. Specifically, we examine whether people believe increases in new technologies’ autonomy comes at the expense of their own autonomy. Integrating psychological research on zero-sum mindsets, autonomy, and technology perceptions, we propose that people see technology autonomy gains as human autonomy losses, despite the possibility that the relationship is objectively a win-win. This “zero-sum autonomy mindset” in turn negatively affects new technology adoption. Two cross-sectional studies with representative samples, three experiments, and a social media field study (overall N = 39,004) provide evidence for this reasoning. Results show that the majority of respondents exhibits a zero-sum autonomy mindset, and that this mindset causally drives aversion toward technology adoption. We further show that aversion can be mitigated by applying one of two intervention strategies: “unfixing” autonomy perceptions and aligning technologies’ goals with those of people. Overall, these findings contribute to our understanding of the joint trajectory of technology and humans. They offer a plausible explanation for the common negative reception of new technologies and means to improve the human–technology relationship."
